                                <p>PowerShell is great for automating processes, managing servers and just about anything else you need to do on the Windows platform from an administrative perspective. As an admin though, you may need to service individuals who know nothing about PowerShell, command lines or consoles. You will need advanced GUI tools that you or your customers can run on their desktops to get you the information you need to solve their problems. Additionally, advanced PowerShell developers and administrators need more advanced tooling. Using PowerShell Studio, we will walk you through the workflow of creating GUI based tools that run PowerShell behind the scenes. </p>

                                <p class="speaker"><strong>Benjamin Hodge</strong><br />Kemp Technologies</p>
                                <p>Are you paying attention to DevOps? Adoption of DevOps practices can greatly improve your company’s deployment efficiency. PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) helps teams take the management of their Windows-based infrastructure into the DevOps space by capturing their infrastructure as "code". The declarative PowerShell model enables autonomous, and transparent configuration and deployment of Windows infrastructure and components. Capturing infrastructure as "code" is not only a means to manage what they have, at scale and speed, it is also a way to decouple the complexity of their existing environment in order to facilitate a migration to the cloud. Come see how DSC works and how you can use it to make configuration of internal applications, databases, and other infrastructure elements more efficient.<p>

                                <p>With DevOps pratices gaining momentum in the enterprises and startups, it is important for infrastructure administrators gear up for this new way of working. Infrastructure as code practices enable administrators to implement infrastrcture configuration as code. Administrators in their new role as infrastructure developers need to think and act like application developers. This sessions the attendees through what infrastructure as code is and what role DSC plays here.</p>

                                <p>While there are lots of PowerShell scripts available online that come in handy when we need to achieve certain administrative tasks, wouldn't it be better to be able to create the script ourselves? This session will deliver a primer to PowerShell scripting enough to equip administrators to achieve or, better yet, automate certain administrative tasks. The session will sample some administrative SharePoint scripting along the way.</p>

                                <p>In the rough and tumble world of IT Pro’s and project deadlines there’s a lot of incentive to just bang out a few “one liners” and focus on “getting the job done”. At the time this makes perfect sense but there’s a big price paid in terms of re-usability and maintenance of that code if we just leave it that way after the dust has settled. In this talk Benjamin will show you how to use a few simple rules to quickly take the ugliest code that you (or others!) have created in the heat of the moment and produce beautiful, elegant functions and modules that you can be proud of.</p>

Using object orientation in PowerShell can take your scripts go to different level.

The session will focus on using .NET with PowerShell – creating classes in PowerShell, objects, reference types, events, loading assembly and alike. Leverage your .NET skills and create managed-PowerShell scripts!</p>

                                <p>As we write more and more Production PowerShell code, good quality testing is essential to ensure it is Production ready. PowerShell now includes a Testing Framework for PowerShell; Pester. In this session, we will take an already written function and write Pester tests for it. Also we will take a look at writing tests first and then do Behaviour driven development of the code.
Build Trust into your code before you deploy and use in Production!</p>

                                <p class="speaker"><strong>Ritesh Modi</strong><br />Microsoft</p>
                                <p>In the current world of Information Technology, protective measures do not stop at the network edge.  There have been reports to indicate the need to protect assets using measures that reduce administrative access.  While the principle of least privilege has always been known to IT Security professionals, there is a need in the industry for a standardized method of constructing an operator experience that reduces access with a more sophisticated level of granularity than what is available in many traditional access control models. Custom Remoting Constrained endpoints helps us to achieve that. PowerShell Web Access (PSWA) feature in Windows Server 2012 allows remote administrative access to a set of servers with granular delegated access and only expose specific administrative privileges to different levels to support teams. PowerShell Web Access combined with custom constrained endpoints bring you a great way to manage and delegate admin access remotely. This level 400 demo heavy session will delve into the details about using Powershell Web Access along with Remoting constrained endpoints.</p>

                                <p>A Windows PowerShell provider allows any data store to be exposed like a file system as if it were a mounted drive. In this session I will share my experience with writing PowerShell Providers for systems, the challenges I came across while doing so, and how I solved them. You will learn when you should consider creating a Provider versus cmdlets, and how to integrate help into your Providers you create along with the generic commands used. This session will feature some great demos to demonstrate the power of Providers using DELL PowerShell Provider and how easy it is going to get managing Dell systems (primarily client systems). As a natural next step to management using PowerShell, I will briefly demonstrate how DSC can be wrapped around the existing implementation.</p>

                                <p>SharePoint Online Management Shell is a Windows PowerShell module that you can use to efficiently manage SharePoint Online users, sites, site collections, and organizations. Command-line operations in Windows PowerShell are composed of cmdlets.
                                <p>The Management Sell consists of the below cmdlets</p>
                                <p>1.	User Management</p>
                                <p>2.	Group management</p>
                                <p>3.	Site Collection Management</p>
                                <p>4.	Monitoring</p>
                                <p>5.	OneDrive</p>

                                    With the differences in SharePoint Online and On-Premises we will look at the key KPI's that are required for each environment from a SharePoint Administrator Point of view and how we can perform most of these much needed reporting solutions using PowerShell.

                                    From there we will also look at a visual representation of this within SharePoint - for those that dare to hold KPI information in the system that they are wanting to report on.

                                    From here on this should give you an evolutionary trajectory on whether this as a solution is correct within your environment or whether you may wish to tweek this as required for your own circumstances
